Welcome to the journey of Smoccichino! This ambitious fixed-wing drone project started with high hopes and plenty of enthusiasm. Here's how it unfolded.
## Meet Smoccichino
The dream begins:

Doesn't it look professional? Surely, it'll take to the skies with grace!

## Under Construction
A sneak peek into the making process:

The wings are finally coming together:

Check out those ailerons! Massive, and definitely not under-dimensioned.\
If this flies, aerospace engineering might just be an elaborate prank!

## Engineering Adjustments
We encountered a minor issue: the plane seemed a bit unbalanced on one wing. Time for some fine-tuning:

## The Final Chapter
And then... tragedy struck. The end of Smoccichino:

Poor Smoccichino! How could it not fly after all that effort?

Second and last try

Despite its crash-and-burn finale, Smoccichino was a project full of learning, fun, and laughter. Here's to future attempts and a brighter flight path ahead!
